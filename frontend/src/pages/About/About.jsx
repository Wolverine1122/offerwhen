        <p>As a CS major myself, I have lurked (and still do) in many CS subreddits and discord servers.</p>
        <p>It has been quite helpful being in a community of self-driven TC chasers and realizing that I can do it too.</p>
        <p>Before creating this webapp, I used to check process-tracking channels and ask questions from other applicants how they performed on OAs and interviews.</p>
        <p>It can soon be a mundane job to keep track of the minimum you gotta do to pass these stages.</p>
        <p>So I decided to change the world and create yet another CRUD app.</p>
